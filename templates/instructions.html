      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
	Pictionaire is an online multiplayer drawing game for two to five players. Players can take on the role of their favorite artists, from Van Gogh to Jackson Pollock, as they sketch their way to the top!
      </p>
      <h2>Making and Joining Rooms</h2>
      <p>
	Create a room using the field on the room list. If it is left blank, a random name will be generated. Alternatively, join an existing room from the list by clicking on the room title.
      </p>
      <p>
	A room requires a minimum of two players to begin the game, with a maximum of five.
      </p>
      <p>
	To leave a room, you must click the link at the bottom of the screen.
      </p>
      <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
      <p>
	The rules of the game are as follows:
      </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>One player is randomly assigned a word, and has 60 seconds to draw it.</li>
	  <li>Other players must try to guess the word being drawn before the time runs out. Guesses are inputted directly into the chat window.</li>
	  <ul>
	    <li>The first person to correctly guess the word wins three points.</li>
	    <li>Subsequent correct guesses from other players award one point each.</li>
	    <li>If at least one player guesses the word, the player drawing it will receive two points.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <li>Whoever earns the most points after everyone has drawn twice is declared the winner of that game!</li>
	</ul>
      <h2>Accounts</h2>
      <p>
	An account is not needed to play, but game statistics will not be recorded unless the user is signed in.
